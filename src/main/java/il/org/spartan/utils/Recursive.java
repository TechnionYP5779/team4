 * <li>Implement interface {@link Nested} for the same concept, except that
 * stream return ancestors.
 * <li>Factor commonalities between the new interface and this interface. What
 * should the new interface be called?
 * <li>Create a new interface that unifies {@link Nested} and {@link Recursive},
 * to be called what?
 * <li>Re-implement class {@link Environment} using the diamond hierarchy that
 * you are
 * <li>Revise material on design patterns. Do you think interface names should
 * be changed? How? Write your answer as JavaDOC: don't bother with formatting.
 * <li>Otherwise, don't touch any documentation, before you attend the JavaDOC
 * lecture. Do add {@code @author} and {@code @since}, but nothing more. You
 * will have to document this interface, and all methods, but only after that.
 * <li>If there are {@code }{@link Test} methods, make sure they run. Don't add
 * any tests, even if you think you know what you are doing, before attending
 * the TDD lecture.
 * <li>Apply self judgment, don't come running to me with every little dilemma
 * you have.
