   * formally, all {@link Iterator} instances that method {@link #iterator()}
   * returns are exhausted after precisely the same number of calls to
   * {@link Iterator#hasNext()}
   * <li>This fixed size can be computed efficiently, specifically without
   * exhausting the sequence items that this iterable may yield.
